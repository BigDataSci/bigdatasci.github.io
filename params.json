{"name":"Big Data Science","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Big Data Science\r\nMy name is Justin Miller, I am a computer scientist and engineer specializing in big data research with a focus on analytic system operations. \r\n\r\nI created this domain (\"BigDataSci\") to help me organize my work into a clear consistent direction. \r\n\r\n### Interests\r\nMy current research focuses on expanding upon my knowledge of the following subjects. \r\n* Big data system operations (beyond but also including Hadoop). \r\n* Approaches for cohesively integrating real time processing (Apache Storm, Apache Flink, Apache Spark Streaming) with batch processing (traditional Hadoop, Pig, Spark) with near real time visualization dashboards (ElasticSearch). \r\n* Data management concepts that present in complex systems. Examples of said concepts include data set management, flow, ingestion, schema design, lineage, and data quality. \r\n* Role based access control. \r\n* Reliability (processing is consistent with requirements ex: only once), durability (surviving system failures), manageability. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJustin Miller (@mageru) \r\n","google":"UA-74104232-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
